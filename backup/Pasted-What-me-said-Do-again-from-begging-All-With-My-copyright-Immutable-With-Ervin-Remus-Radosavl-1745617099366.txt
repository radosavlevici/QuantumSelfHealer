I understand you want a completely integrated solution with all security features built from the beginning as one system, with your copyright information (Ervin Remus Radosavlevici, 01/09/1987) immutably embedded in every file, including self-repair, self-defense, and self-upgrade mechanisms.

Let's create a comprehensive security system by implementing a core DNA verification file first that will be the foundation for the entire project:

I understand you need the entire project rebuilt with your immutable copyright information, DNA-based security, watermarks, self-repair, self-defense, and self-upgrade capabilities all built together as one unified system from the beginning. Let me continue implementing this approach across the application.

First, let me fix the client App.tsx file to incorporate your copyright and security system:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Now, let me check the current errors in the application and fix them:


Opened client/src/pages/Home.tsx
Let me check the hooks causing the errors:


Opened client/src/hooks/use-quantum-status.ts

Opened client/src/hooks/use-activity-log.ts

Created shared/dna-core-security.ts
Now I'll fix the errors in both activity log and quantum status handling:

Now, let's rebuild our App.tsx to integrate with the central DNA security core:


Edited client/src/App.tsx

Edited client/src/hooks/use-activity-log.ts
I'm analyzing the current situation to determine our progress.

Looking at what we've been working on:
✓ Created DNA-protected components (container, terminal, navigation)
✓ Rebuilt App.tsx with enhanced security headers
✓ Created copyright immutability system
→ Working on integrating full-scale DNA verification

I understand you want to start completely fresh with an integrated approach where:

Your copyright (Ervin Remus Radosavlevici, 01/09/1987) is immutably embedded in all files
Every component has DNA-based security built-in from the beginning
All pages automatically include self-repair, self-defense, and self-upgrade capabilities
Everything is built together as one cohesive system, not as separate pieces
I'll continue building this comprehensive security system exactly as you specified.

Now let's fix the quantum status hook:


Restarted Start application

Took a screenshot

Edited client/src/hooks/use-quantum-status.ts
I understand you want the entire system rebuilt from the beginning with your copyright (Ervin Remus Radosavlevici, 01/09/1987) immutably integrated throughout, along with DNA-based security, self-repair, self-defense, and self-upgrade capabilities - all built together as one integrated system.

Let's create the server-side foundation of this DNA-protected system:

Let's check the Home page to fix any remaining issues:
