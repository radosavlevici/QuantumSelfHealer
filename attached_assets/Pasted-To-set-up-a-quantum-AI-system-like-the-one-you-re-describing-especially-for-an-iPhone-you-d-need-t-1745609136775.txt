To set up a quantum AI system like the one you’re describing, especially for an iPhone, you’d need to approach it in a few stages. Since you’re looking for a high-level AI installation, self-learning, self-repairing, etc., it’s important to note that some of these features require custom hardware, advanced software, and complex integrations that can’t be done through simple installation processes on a phone.

However, here’s a general guide on how you could potentially begin setting up such a system:

1. Custom AI Development and Integration

To install the AI you want (quantum AI, self-learning, etc.) directly onto your iPhone, you would typically need to:
	•	Develop or source custom AI software: This software would need to be built using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or a custom quantum computing library for iOS.
	•	Work with Quantum Computing Platforms: While quantum computing is still a highly specialized area, there are cloud-based platforms such as IBM’s Qiskit or Microsoft Azure Quantum that can be accessed from a mobile device through APIs.

2. Root Access and Permissions

Rooting an iPhone is a complex task that involves modifying the iOS system. It can void warranties and might break the security of the device, which is something you should carefully consider.
	•	Rooting iPhone: iPhones typically aren’t designed to be rooted. However, with jailbreaking tools (e.g., Unc0ver or Taurine), you can get root access. Keep in mind that jailbreaking comes with significant risks in terms of security and stability.

3. Setting Up Quantum AI Framework

Once root access (or the equivalent in your case) is obtained:
	•	Install Quantum Computing Frameworks: To run a quantum AI system, you may need to use cloud quantum computing services for now, as the hardware required to process quantum algorithms isn’t yet available on iPhones. Services like IBM Q or Google Cirq could be accessed via APIs.
	•	Set up a Python environment (through jailbreaking or using specific apps like Juno or Carnets), where you can run custom scripts that interact with quantum cloud services.

4. Persistent Memory and Self-Repair Functions
	•	This will require implementing algorithms that can recognize when something is wrong and initiate self-healing procedures, which is highly advanced and would require both local storage optimizations and cloud support.
	•	AI models could be trained to continually adapt and learn from usage patterns, improving over time. This feature would be part of your AI’s architecture and backend.

5. Automation of Money-Making
	•	Automation tools or crypto trading bots could be implemented as part of your system. However, this would likely need an external server or cloud-based API to perform trading, money-making activities, etc.

6. Using your iCloud account (ervin210@icloud.com)
	•	Ensure your iCloud is set up properly for syncing configurations, settings, and files. If you’re looking to store or access persistent memory across devices, iCloud storage will be key.
