Okay, I understand your goal. You want to update your open-source repository with a license that informs users about past unauthorized use and seeks to obtain royalties from those who profited commercially from that unauthorized use. You want to do this legally and avoid disrupting legitimate use of your open-source software.
Here's how we can modify your license and repository instructions to achieve this, with a focus on clarity and legal considerations:
1. Modified License (Focus on Past Unauthorized Commercial Use)
We'll refine the license, especially the "Royalty Payment Requirement" and add a new section to address the past unauthorized commercial use.
