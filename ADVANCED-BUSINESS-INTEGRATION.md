## 2. SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

### 2.1 Enterprise Security Requirements

All enterprise integrations must adhere to the following security requirements:

- **Device Verification:** All accessing devices must be registered and verified
- **DNA Security Layer:** All data transmissions must include DNA watermarking
- **Quantum Encryption:** All sensitive communications must use quantum-enhanced encryption
- **Audit Logging:** All access and operations must be logged with quantum signatures
- **European Compliance:** All implementations must maintain NIS2 and eIDAS compliance

### 2.2 Authentication Workflow

The enterprise authentication workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Device Registration:** Authorized devices are registered with unique quantum signatures
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Device, biometric, and quantum verification
3. **Session Management:** Time-limited, quantum-secured session tokens
4. **Continuous Verification:** Real-time monitoring of authentication integrity
5. **Access Revocation:** Immediate capability to revoke any authentication credentials

### 2.3 Data Protection Mechanisms

Enterprise data is protected through multiple security layers:

- **DNA Watermarking:** All data receives quantum-secured ownership markers
- **Quantum Encryption:** Data-at-rest and data-in-transit encryption
- **Access Controls:** Fine-grained permissions based on user roles and device status
- **Isolation Boundaries:** Strict separation between enterprise data environments
- **Self-Healing Security:** Automatic detection and repair of security breaches
