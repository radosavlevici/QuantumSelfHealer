# Quantum AI Assistant

An advanced hybrid AI integration system with comprehensive natural language processing and intelligent terminal interaction capabilities, designed to simplify complex technical workflows for developers of all skill levels.

## Overview

Quantum AI Assistant is a sophisticated application that integrates multiple AI providers with quantum computing capabilities. It features a terminal-like interface with self-repair algorithms, persistent memory via iCloud, and custom quantum algorithms. Built with security at its core, it provides a natural language interface that translates everyday language into quantum terminal commands, making quantum computing accessible to users without technical knowledge.
