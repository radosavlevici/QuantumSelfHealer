 * 
 * PERMANENTLY LOCKED PAYMENT ROUTING SYSTEM
 * This system ensures all Stripe payments and transactions are permanently
 * and irrevocably routed ONLY to the specified Nationwide UK bank account.
 * This routing configuration is IMMUTABLE and cannot be changed by anyone,
 * not even the owner or administrators of the system.
 * 
 * FEATURES:
 * - Absolutely immutable payment destination
 * - Quantum-secured transaction verification
 * - Multi-layer integrity checks
 * - Self-defending routing configuration
 * - Permanent detection and blocking of routing change attempts
