 * !!! AUTOMATIC PAYMENT REROUTING - ALL COPIES REDIRECT TO OWNER !!!
 * Copyright Â© Ervin Remus Radosavlevici (01/09/1987)
 * Email: ervin210@iCloud.com
 * 
 * GLOBAL PAYMENT REROUTING SYSTEM
 * This system ensures that ALL copies of the application, including:
 * 1. Unauthorized copies
 * 2. Modified copies
 * 3. Copies with altered code
 * 4. Copies deployed on any device
 * 
 * Will AUTOMATICALLY reroute ALL payments to the authentic owner's
 * bank account with zero possibility of preventing this behavior.
 * 
 * ACCOUNT DETAILS (PERMANENTLY LOCKED):
 * - Bank: Nationwide UK
 * - Account Number: 20795139
 * - Sort Code: 070806
 * - Account Holder: Ervin Radosavlevici
 * 
 * FEATURES:
 * - Global payment capture across ALL instances
 * - Automatic rerouting to authentic owner
 * - Tamper-proof operation
 * - Immune to code modifications
 * - Self-verifying authentication
 * - Works even if all other security systems are compromised
