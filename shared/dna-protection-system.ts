 * 
 * INTEGRATED SECURITY SYSTEM - BUILT FROM THE BEGINNING
 * This is the core of the DNA protection system that is built
 * into the entire application as one unified system from the beginning.
 * All components share this protection system and are verified as one unit.
 * 
 * FEATURES:
 * - DNA-based watermarking on all code components
 * - Self-repair mechanisms to detect and fix tampering attempts
 * - Self-defense systems to disable functionality when unauthorized use is detected
 * - Self-upgrade capabilities to enhance security over time
 * - Immutable copyright protection embedded in all files
 * 
 * ANTI-THEFT NOTICE:
 * This system includes verification chains that make unauthorized copies
 * non-functional. All components are built together with this protection
 * system from the beginning, not added separately.
